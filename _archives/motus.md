**Overview:** \\
In a diverse team of four, we worked to incentivize housing construction in dense urban areas. Ultimately we created Motūs, mobility as a service. We provide infrastructure to new building developments, turning mundane tasks into an opportunity to meet and connect with your neighbors. Our final prototype explored how tenants of an apartment building might engage with an elevator bulletin to join a Motūs enabled carpool.

**Context:**\\
 8 Hours, Spring CoLab Makeathon, IDEO CoLab

**What I did:**\\
 Experience Design, User Research, Product Thinking, Brainstorming/Ideation, and Branding
