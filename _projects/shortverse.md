<!-- Short film has long been the training ground for the next generation of filmmakers. Most filmmakers like The Daniels (*Everything Everywhere All At Once*) and Jim Cummings (*Thunder Road*) find their unique voice while making short films. It’s where new ideas, new characters, and new techniques from the digital revolution to realtime simulations in Unreal Engine are explored and tested before making it to mainstream movies and shows.

Now, [Short of the Week](http://shortoftheweek.com), the premiere site for showcasing the world’s best online short films since 2007, is launching a new platform called [Shortverse](http://shortverse.com) to bring together the top filmmakers, industry professionals, and fans of short film in one place. Shortverse aims to tear down the traditional barriers that outsiders have faced when trying to break into the industry by providing a platform for the next generation of filmmakers to reach audiences and opportunities.

Shortverse offers filmmakers the tools they need to find audiences, host a film page, manage screenings, connect with professionals, and find collaborators. It offers industry professionals the best way to find trending films and connect with emerging filmmakers. -->

Shortverse is an innovative platform designed to unite top filmmakers, industry professionals, and short film enthusiasts in a single online community. 

Shortverse aims to revolutionize the film industry by dismantling traditional barriers and empowering emerging filmmakers. With its wide range of features, including audience engagement tools, film page hosting, and professional networking capabilities, Shortverse provides a powerful avenue for filmmakers to connect with wider audiences and seize new opportunities. Simultaneously, industry insiders can leverage Shortverse to explore trending films, discover promising talent, and foster meaningful connections within the filmmaking community.
