{{ main }}
After a nine week participatory design process, we developed a system that allows for quick strap length adjustment between two different sized people, on any backpack. Through multiple workshops with our design participants we were able to zero in on the pain points of co-travel and build a solution to meet their needs.

##### Participatory Design
We started out drawing concepts to solve rather narrow problems, some were focused on security, others on ease of access. After fifty different backpack ideas, we had to take a step back and reassess. We would not be able design a solution without exploring the core problem: the shared backpack experience.
