{{ main }}
The Albers Principle states that a color’s communication is affected by its relationship to its surrounding colors. With this principle in mind, I set out to develop my own web game to explain the importance of context in a fun and interactive manner—creating a new twist on an old school game.\\

##### Process

After exploring various arcade classics, I decided on Pong because of its simplicty, both for new users and developing purposes. I then designed the game screens and a few thousand lines of code changes later Albers Pong went live!

##### Going Forward
I learned a lot developing Albers Pong, both in the world of development and design. Looking back, I do wish I spent a little more time exploring the color scheme of the game as well as tweaking the subtle details of the game's design.  Coding wise, a future version might include a 'hard mode' that restricts users from changing paddle color unless the ball is on the other side of the screen.
