First I led the team in a teardown of the current systems. We walked-through the design of IssueVoter, the original app, and **called out two key problems: the hierarchy of information and the bias of color.** 

Then we looked at the raw text of a bill on Congress.gov and realized how important  concise, well laid out information would be to helping inform votes before they make a decision.

Congress is constantly titling bills with branded and vague titles that leave voters confused. We wanted to make sure our app brought the issue at hand forward, not coded title of a bill. Additionally we knew that using red and green ran the risk of inherent color bias, so we spent a lot of time exploring how we could build a better visual language that would not affect how users might vote on a specific bill.

We decided to focus on millennials who are passionate about the political process, but are not necessarily sure where to start. After we laid out who we were designing for, I helped draw out the information architecture of the app. **The IA was a vital step in talking through the features and core moments of Voicebox as a team.**

Together we designed the user flows and look and feel of Voicebox, focused on creating an approachable and playful tone that respected the weight of the topic. This balance was key to creating an inviting but meaningful application experience. Our insights from user testing taught us that our approach to reducing color bias, using orange and purple, worked! Users were able to quickly learn the relationships of color through our use of repetition throughout the app.
