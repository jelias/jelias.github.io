##### Identifying the problem
With detailed task analyses and user research, we uncovered the difficulties of making tea on the go. With a problem statement in mind, we began brainstorming possible interventions for the tea making process.

##### Outcomes
**After six weeks, we produced Steavie, a smart tea maker accessible to all.** While we all wore multiple hats for the project, I focused on directing the storytelling and designing the interface and animations of Steavie.

##### Reflection
**During this project, I got into a serious biking accident and broke my collarbone.** Considering the limitations of my situation I am proud of how much I was able to contribute, however, I was not able to spend as much energy focusing on the small details as I would've liked. With more time, I would reshoot our product video highlighting more of the product's features. Moreover, I would have personally worked on the editing of the video and embedding of animations. Sadly, my computer usage was rather limited with one arm.
