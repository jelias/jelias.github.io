Setting Type was my fourth project in _DES 209 - Fundamentals of Typography_. The goal of the project was to organize the required information—a sport from the XXIII Winter Olympic Games, 150+ words of text, the date and location of the Olympic Games, and at least three athletes from your chosen sport—on an 8 ×10 inch composition.
