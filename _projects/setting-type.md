Setting Type was my fourth project in _DES 209 - Fundamentals of Typography_. The goal of this project was to organize the required information—a sport from the XXIII Winter Olympic Games, 150+ words of text, the date and location of the Olympic Games, and at least three athletes from your chosen sport—on an 8 ×10 inch composition.

##### Next Heading

You don’t need captions because the images and photos are intertwined. They flow together, to tell a story. Filler Text... Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out.

##### There must be a reason there is another heading
If there is no purpose, there better be more images. No one wants to read. You don’t need captions because the images and photos are intertwined. They flow together, to tell a story.
