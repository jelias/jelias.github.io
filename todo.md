# Site v2! Mar 2018/?

### Design
- Go sketch a bunch of ideas yo
- New way to display projects.
    - full page cards? [see Netty's site](https://www.nettylim.com/)
- Better layout of project pages
    - more images!?
    - "show a chronological way of certain concepts or iterations you had that evolved into the final poster or opposed to just a sketch and some writing that would help."
- Tweak caption font size for projects pages
- Archives page
    - Link to the archives in the paragraph about design. It can just be a giant version of /design.
    #### Maybe
    - Add parallax to project image?
    - Image Modals for project pages
    - Add gloss to project cards
    - Add inner shaddow for hero image

### Journal
- Keep scroll position
- Add a index of past years of journal! Where to put it though...

### Home 
- Add a line like, "here's a picture of me!" to make the image feel less random below the paragraph?
- Or make the photo more integrated, like to the left of the paragraph.
- Create /now page? Link it on my hello page.

### Nav 
- ~~Make words smaller? why are they so big!?~~

### Random
- Make all one css doc
  - smaller font on love
  - ~~change back to numbers!? oops~~
  - ~~fix italics issue with journal day~~
- Make a page for papu, his stories and his life? <3
- Add subtle shadows to fixed-nav as it scrolls?
- Better 404 page
- Add seo to pages?
- Animate page changing? (gives more flow, less hopping around pages)
    - transition.js?
- Create "clean url" version
    - temp fix: each page has a `folder > index.html` ...yeah you get it, it's real ugly

# Site (v3)
- All one jekyll site!? Use different page layouts for the different pages. This would be so awesome.
- Revamp the css. Why are you using a class for text-paragraphs!? Just use 'p'.
- Create a type style guide/heiarchy system! (in InDesign probably)
    - Change all fonts to em? Why tho? (Maybe just to keep them all the same?)

### Things I Love
