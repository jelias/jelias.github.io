###### Hi, I'm Jacob. _(he/him)_{:.xsmall .font-base-fix}

I'm an Interaction Designer passionate about people & communities, complex problems, and abstract ideas. I grew up in the [Midwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northbrook,_Illinois) and graduated from the University of Washington [Interaction Design](https://art.washington.edu/design/interaction-design-bdes) program. 
My past work includes collaborations with Google, IDEO, and Short of the Week.

As a storyteller, my passions in filmmaking and writing provide an opportunity to further communicate ideas and powerful emotions. At my core, storytelling and designing, is what I do. Outside, I love to bike, climb, snowboard, (the list goes on) as much as possible to [clear my head, slow down, and focus](https://web.stanford.edu/~cbross/Ecospeak/wildernessletter.html).



Please feel free to [reach out](ma&#105;lt&#111;&#58;j&#37;40j%65&#108;&#37;69a&#115;&#46;%6&#68;&#37;6&#53;)—whether you just want to chat or are interested in working together! I am always happy to talk :). My [resume is available here](/assets/Elias_Resume_2023.pdf).
