###### Hi, I'm Jacob.
Born and raised in Chicago, IL, I am currently studying [Interaction Design](https://art.washington.edu/design/interaction-design-bdes) at the University of Washington. To inspire creativity and stay active I water ski, snowboard, and rock climb as much as possible.

Using design as a lens to view the world, I also make films on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/jelias), post shots on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/jelias), and—occasionally—publish my writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jelias).

Thanks for stopping by and please feel free to [contact me](mailto&#58;%6Aa%&#54;&#51;obee&#37;&#54;C&#37;6&#57;&#37;61s&#64;gm&#37;61%69&#108;&#46;co&#37;6D)—whether you just want to chat or are interested in working together! I am **open for summer 2019 internships** and my resume is available [here](/assets/Elias_Resume_Dec_2018.pdf).
