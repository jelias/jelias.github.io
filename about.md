###### Hi, I'm Jacob. _(he/him)_{:.xsmall .font-base-fix}

I'm an Interaction Designer passionate about people, complex problems, and abstract ideas. I grew up in the [Midwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northbrook,_Illinois) and graduated from the [University of Washington](https://art.washington.edu/design/interaction-design-bdes) in 2020. My past work includes collaborations with Google, IDEO, and Short of the Week.

Complimenting design, my passions in filmmaking and writing have opened my world and provided an opportunity to communicate ideas and powerful emotions. At the core, storytelling, and designing, is what I do. Outside, I love to bike, climb, snowboard, (the list goes on) as much as possible to [clear my head, slow down, and focus](https://web.stanford.edu/~cbross/Ecospeak/wildernessletter.html).

Please feel free to [reach out](mailto&#58;%6Aa%&#54;&#51;obee&#37;&#54;C&#37;6&#57;&#37;61s&#64;gm&#37;61%69&#108;&#46;co&#37;6D)â€”whether you just want to chat or are interested in working together! I am always happy to talk :). My resume is available [here](/assets/Elias_Resume_Nov_2021.pdf).
