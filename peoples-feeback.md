    off the bat i feel like the text on all of it is too big (just in general like even the top bar with "home, design, etc." feels like it takes up a bit too much space?) and goes too far across each line, maybe putting the pictures next to the text it relates to instead of across would b better? or some other way for the text to not look/feel so long. Like the first page I feel like u maybe shouldn't even have to scroll, i should see "hi, i'm jacob" and ur face at the same time so it's like "oh hi jacob!" lol
    
    the nav bar at the top is bolder where it says design but it's kinda confusing if that's the title or not. i think i get that it's the design page, but it's not in the center and still looks like part of the nav bar but is big enough that it also kind of looks like a title? if that makes sense
    if u shrink the nav bar or put it somewhere else entirely and then put a title on the page i think it's b much more clear
    
    on til: i like the concept and i like that it's there it's cool to read but ya i'd do the underline or something like that... maybe make the one that it's not on lighter (in color) and smaller. they're similar enough that it looked like a secondary part of the header
    i like that u shrunk the text one "things i love"

    I like what you've done so far, especially just how simple it is too, and I just have a couple of pointers.

    I would remove "northern suburbs of Chicago", it seems like information you'd tell your friends and would be irrelevant to the average recruiter, etc.
    Add a little more white space? the pages seem a little crowded. You could do this by adding padding/margin to the paragraphs and images or making text smaller.
    And last one, if there is a way you can show a chronological way of certain concepts or iterations you had that evolved into the final poster or opposed to just a sketch and some writing that would help.

    Writing about your work is terrific! Valuing words (and being good at succinctly writing and talking about your work) is awesome and a huge plus as a designer.
    I think the number one thing I’d say about the work is to put a little bit more explanation is to certain things- I’m interested in where you’re going with things like the ‘settings interface’ piece and if I was reading through your portfolio for a job, it might be nice to get some insight into your design decisions (e.g: does this interface get used for other things? Is this just for the bluetooth setting panel? What does the pencil in the upper right do?) when you can highlight that info, that really helps designers hiring understand where your thinking lies.

    Auntie Ellen:
	Website is very nice but you're right-too much text and no graphics. It would be easiest to add them to your list page. Maybe if no graphics then some color? Good job. 
	That's my opinion. Maybe create different backgrounds for each section. A collage of things/people on your list would be good for that page.
