This is my photo page. For me, design is the bridge between science and humanities, combining empathy and technology to solve a wide range of problems. It often goes unnoticed and is taken for granted, yet the greatest solutions are only obvious once discovered. It is a never-ending process full of failures, iterations, and constant learning.
