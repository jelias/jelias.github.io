Make your own site, don't just copy mine. It really isn't that complicated, I made my 'Under Construction' page in a two nights. If you want help I'm on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_jelias_), but I'm really not the best person to ask.

You can learn how to code on [TeamTreehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/jacobelias) among other things, it's pretty awesome. Or you can learn from [tutsplus](https://courses.tutsplus.com/free/), which isn't bad either.

This site uses [Dave Gamache's](https://github.com/dhg) responsive framework [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) incase you were wondering.
