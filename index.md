###### Hi, I'm Jacob.
I’m from Chicago, IL and am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Design at the University of Washington.
Outside of design, my biggest passions are waterskiing, snowboarding, and rock climbing. From time to time, you can find me writing on Medium, posting shots on Dribbble, and pushing commits to GitHub.

I built this website as a place to share my designs, thoughts, and lists. Thanks for stopping by and please feel free to contact me—whether you just want to chat or are interested in working together.

Here is one more paragraph about my hobbies and interests. On the side I like to take photos and make films with my friends. I would love to collaborate on a project sometime and am always interested in learning new things!
