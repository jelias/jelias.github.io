**My explorations utilize design as a medium** capable of connecting individuals, communities, and systems. I work across the sciences and humanities to explore the following research questions:

- [How might we facilitate human connection through the discovery and sharing of music?](/projects/encounter)
- What factors contribute to Emergency First Responders effectively responding to situations involving people with mental illness?
- What might an inclusive future look like and how can technology play a role in promoting equity?
- How can motion libraries and everyday affordances inform direct interaction models for augmented reality?

- How might we engage mechanisms for empathy to create more connected communities?
- How can the curation of media explore the moments and memories that life has to offer?
