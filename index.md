**My explorations utilize the design process as a framework** capable of connecting individuals, communities, and systems. I work across media and tools to explore speculative worlds, complex systems, and the forefront of technologies. 

Most recently I built arc, [a collaborative installation in AI and generative filmmaking](https://arc.jelias.me). I am currently powering prosperity at [Intuit](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) and [reinventing the film festival](https://www.shortoftheweek.com/news/the-biggest-thing-weve-ever-done/) at [Short of the Week](https://www.shortoftheweek.app/).

I thrive on breaking down complex problems into more tangible experiences.\\

I work across the sciences and humanities to explore the following research questions:

- How might we engage mechanisms for empathy to create more connected communities?
- How can the curation of media explore the moments and memories that life has to offer?
