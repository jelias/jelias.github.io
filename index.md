###### Hi, I'm Jacob.
Born and raised in Chicago, IL, I am currently studying [Interaction Design](https://art.washington.edu/design/interaction-design-bdes) at the University of Washington. My explorations utilize design as a medium capable of connecting individuals, communities, and systems. I work across the sciences and humanities to explore the following research questions: 
- How might we facilitate human connection through the discovery and sharing of music?
- How can the curation of media explore the moments and memories that life has to offer?
- What might an inclusive future look like and how can technology play a role in promoting equity?

Using design as a lense to view the world, I also write on Medium, post shots on Dribbble, and—occasionally—push commits to GitHub. To inspire creativity and stay active in other areas I also water ski, snowboard, and rock climb.

Thanks for stopping by and please feel free to [contact me](mailto&#58;%6Aa%&#54;&#51;obee&#37;&#54;C&#37;6&#57;&#37;61s&#64;gm&#37;61%69&#108;&#46;co&#37;6D)—whether you just want to chat or are interested in working together! I am **open for summer 2019 internships** and my resume is available on request.
