**My explorations utilize the design process as a framework** capable of connecting individuals, communities, and systems. I work across media and tools to explore speculative worlds, complex systems, and the forefront of technologies. 

I'm currently building the universe of short film at [Shortverse](https://shortverse.com){:target="_blank"}, a new platform and community for filmmakers. Past work includes [a collaborative installation in AI and generative filmmaking](https://arc.jelias.me){:target="_blank"}, and collaborations with Google, IDEO, and Intuit.

I thrive on breaking down complex problems into more tangible experiences.\\

I work across the sciences and humanities to explore the following research questions:

- How might we engage mechanisms for empathy to create more connected communities?
- How can the curation of media explore the moments and memories that life has to offer?
