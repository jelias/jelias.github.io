The layout and visual design of all the project pages are super mature and stands out with a high-level of polish. 

Put some more work in the "storytelling" of each project. 
  - For each page, **what is the 1 point about your skills or experience you want someone reading to take away?** 
  - Can you **tell these projects more like stories** where there is some "conflict" that you use your skills to resolve?
  - You do a great job keeping things simple, but can you **keep it simple while also making it feel like scrolling through the page takes me on a journey?**
  
Other 2 pieces of feedback:
  - On the Design page, maybe a header to the section with "_01 Setting Type, _02 Albers Pong, etc."...something like "Featured Projects"
  - Really like how hovering over the project names changes the thumbnail previews. 
  - Suggestion to consider: also having **a 1-sentence summary of the project** as well. _It gives me better signals of which projects I'd want to click into & learn more._
