For me, design is the bridge between science and humanities, combining empathy and technology to solve a wide range of problems. It often goes unnoticed and is taken for granted, yet the greatest solutions are only obvious once discovered. It is a never-ending process full of failures, iterations, and constant learning. I strive to use design to empower humans through technology, providing tools to help improve the quality of life for all. Below is my portfolio of work, each with its own in-depth project overview and reflectionâ€”something I consider extremely important in order to grow as a designer.
