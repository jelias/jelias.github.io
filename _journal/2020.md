## *January 2020*{:.journal-month}

*4*{:.journal-day} Happy 2020 I guess. Maybe one of these days I'll find time to reflect on last year. Right after I fold my three day dry laundry. 

It's been a fan-fucking-tastic 4 days. I feel like slamming my head against a wall. I already did to my desk. This is not the year, these are just the days. Just as I find momentum and energy, someone rips it out from under me. I'm lost. Fuck this. Fuck not feeling motivated or excited. 

I heard three gunshots last night. Welcome back to UDistrict I guess. What happened to the college vigor, the youthful, creative energy. I'm pretty sick of this shit and school hasn't even started. I'm angry.
