## *January 2020*{:.journal-month}

*22*{:.journal-day} Damn. Did not get TEAGUE. I don't apply to many things, not unless I'm interested and really think I would be a good fit. Thinking about not backing down on this one, I feel like if they gave me a week they would see my value. Curious to hear why they didn't want to move forward.

Back on the horse I guess.

*10*{:.journal-day} Good News. My schedule is settled in place now and I'm feeling good about it. I think. Also, Mac Miller just released a song and it's really hitting me. That whole community is really hitting me right now. A lot of people loved him and really needed him. I hope Circles gives them the closure, love and support to continue forth. There's a lot of stories out in the world that are so deeply moving, full of hardship and resilience. I just hope one day I can help even one of them. Or tell their stories. No one should feel so alone.

*8*{:.journal-day} Added Yolk to my website finally. It feels good to push code again. Still have to do a bit more work but this is a good start. Need to focus on Bonderman now...

*4*{:.journal-day} Happy 2020 I guess. Maybe one of these days I'll find time to reflect on last year. Right after I fold my three day dry laundry. 

It's been a fan-fucking-tastic 4 days. I feel like slamming my head against a wall. I already did to my desk. This is not the year, these are just the days. Just as I find momentum and energy, someone rips it out from under me. I'm lost. Fuck this. Fuck not feeling motivated or excited. 

I heard three gunshots last night. Welcome back to UDistrict I guess. What happened to the college vigor, the youthful, creative energy. I'm pretty sick of this shit and school hasn't even started. I'm angry.
