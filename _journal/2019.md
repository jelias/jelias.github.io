## "We're Gonna Make it Fuck" *January 2019*{:.journal-month}

*30*{:.journal-day}Today has been a bit of an up and down of stress. It's hard to hear other that your classmates are getting interviews for the internship you haven't heard back from. But that's ok. Really! It'll work out. As long as I stay curious, and keep creating, it will all work out. *–*{:.new-thought} Sitting in class, trying to stay cool was tough though. I was anxious, antsy. I needed to move. Swimming really helped. 

*29*{:.journal-day} It's crazy to think how close Luke and I are. Just to have such a strong connection with someone, so quickly. From our first days of school. Lucky to call such an awesome person my best friend.

*28*{:.journal-day} It's gonna be a good week. Time for bed though.  Today has been a busy one. Hiking with Marwa this morning was awesome. A little sunrise and breakfast before class was exactly what I needed :).

*24*{:.journal-day}The design career fair is tomorrow... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. It's been a day full of prep. I didn't leave the art building until 7:40—for context, I had a class at 8:30 this morning. Yeah. *–*{:.new-thought} Waiting for the light to turn green I watched a man struggle across the street. He had a limp to his step and in that moment I realized that tomorrow is not all that important. I've been in his shoes, I've struggled to cross the street, get dressed, and live day to day. While I can stay up all night worrying about the career fair, I'd rather take a moment to think about how lucky I am to have my health today. 

*22*{:.journal-day} I need to stop worrying about how to act and trying to figure everything out. It's time to just be. I'm Jacob Elias and I'm really good at being Jacob Elias, so I'm just gonna do my thing.  *–*{:.connected-thought} *"Just show up. And have confidence that it will work out..."*{: .quote} It always does.

*21*{:.journal-day} Having someone that makes you feel like the number one sounds really nice.

*20*{:.journal-day} Bummer moments: when you get stoked about something but then it all falls apart. *–*{:.connected-thought} Really wanted to go to Portland tonight. Why not!? We don't have school tomorrow, let's just send it. Sadly, we've got no where to stay and so just about as fast as the plans formed, they have fallen apart. *–*{:.connected-thought} That's ok though, maybe next time. 

*17*{:.journal-day} Watching Vox's [2018, in 5 minutes](https://youtu.be/4tJJnC26_uw), and then [Google's Search in Review](https://youtu.be/6aFdEhEZQjE) (2016–2018) jump started something, a part of me I haven't thought about in a while. **I got into this because I want to help people.** It's why empathy, acknowledging my privilege, human connection, smiling are all so important to me. *–*{:.new-thought} **If I can make someone else's day just a little bit brighter, someone else's life just a little bit easier, it will all have been worth it.**

*16*{:.journal-day}Surround yourself with people who make you laugh, remind who you are, and tell you it’s gonna be ok.  

*15*{:.journal-day}Been saying "rad" a lot these days... It feels right. Life is pretty  rad.

*12*{:.journal-day} Such an amazing day. Hanging out with the whole crew is always such a blast. And in Crystal! On a blue bird day! Rad.

*10*{:.journal-day} - Wow this is already a lot. How do I already have so much work? Finally sorted out the little things: email, to-do lists, etc. Ready to get to work tomorrow.

*6*{:.journal-day} A little nervous for tomorrow (first day of classes). I'm excited to be in VCD though, I think it'll be good to mix things up. Definitely miss the IxD kids though.

*1*{:.journal-day} Things to remember for 2019:
  - Slowing down is often the answer
  - Spend as much time as you can with the people you love, when you start to take those moments for granted, pinch yourself
  - Turn off your gadgets and look up. Frequently.<br/> Sure it's cool to capture a moment, but it's pretty special to just live it.
  - Just because they are not around does not mean they don't care about you
  - **Wear your helmet.**
  - You don't need to kiss someone at midnight [on new years], hugging your friends tight is pretty special
  - If you have your health, you have everything

Here's to a year full of opportunity, friendships, and wondrous adventures... and probably love, learning, self reflection, and art if I know myself. *–*{:.connected-thought} I'm going try and take it one day at a time. If I focus on being happy day to day, then everything else will fall into place. *–*{:.connected-thought} Can you tell I just reread [The Alchemist](https://smile.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416)? *–*{:.new-thought} Anyway, see ya around 2019.
