## "We're Gonna Make it Fuck" *January 2019*{:.journal-month}

*22*{:.journal-day} I need to stop worrying about how to act and trying to figure everything out. It's time to just be. I'm Jacob Elias and I'm really good at being Jacob Elias, so I'm just gonna do my thing.  *–*{:.connected-thought} *Just show up. And trust and have confidence that it will work out.*{: .quote} It always does.

*21*{:.journal-day} Having someone that makes you feel like the number one sounds really nice.

*20*{:.journal-day} Bummer moments: when you get stoked about something but then it all falls apart. *–*{:.connected-thought} Really wanted to go to Portland tonight. Why not!? We don't have school tomorrow, let's just send it. Sadly, we've got no where to stay and so just about as fast as the plans formed, they have fallen apart. *–*{:.connected-thought} That's ok though, maybe next time. 

*17*{:.journal-day} Watching Vox's [2018, in 5 minutes](https://youtu.be/4tJJnC26_uw), and then [Google's Search in Review](https://youtu.be/6aFdEhEZQjE) (2016–2018) jump started something, a part of me I haven't thought about in a while. **I got into this because I want to help people.** It's why empathy, acknowledging my privilege, human connection, smiling are all so important to me. *–*{:.new-thought} **If I can make someone else's day just a little bit brighter, someone else's life just a little bit easier, it will all have been worth it.**

*16*{:.journal-day}Surround yourself with people who make you laugh, remind who you are, and tell you it’s gonna be ok.  

*15*{:.journal-day}Been saying "rad" a lot these days... It feels right. Life is pretty  rad.

*12*{:.journal-day} Such an amazing day. Hanging out with the whole crew is always such a blast. And in Crystal! On a blue bird day! Rad.

*10*{:.journal-day} - Wow this is already a lot. How do I already have so much work? Finally sorted out the little things: email, to-do lists, etc. Ready to get to work tomorrow.

*6*{:.journal-day} A little nervous for tomorrow (first day of classes). I'm excited to be in VCD though, I think it'll be good to mix things up. Definitely miss the IxD kids though.

*1*{:.journal-day} Things to remember for 2019:
  - Slowing down is often the answer
  - Spend as much time as you can with the people you love, when you start to take those moments for granted, pinch yourself
  - Turn off your gadgets and look up. Frequently.<br/> Sure it's cool to capture a moment, but it's pretty special to just live it.
  - Just because they are not around does not mean they don't care about you
  - **Wear your helmet.**
  - You don't need to kiss someone at midnight [on new years], hugging your friends tight is pretty special
  - If you have your health, you have everything

Here's to a year full of opportunity, friendships, and wondrous adventures... and probably love, learning, self reflection, and art if I know myself. *–*{:.connected-thought} I'm going try and take it one day at a time. If I focus on being happy day to day, then everything else will fall into place. *–*{:.connected-thought} Can you tell I just reread [The Alchemist](https://smile.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416)? *–*{:.new-thought} Anyway, see ya around 2019.
