## "We're Gonna Make it Fuck" *January 2019*{:.journal-month}

*15*{:.journal-day} - Been saying "rad" a lot these days... It feels right. Life is pretty  rad.

*12*{:.journal-day} Such an amazing day. Hanging out with the whole crew is always such a blast. And in Crystal! On a blue bird day! Rad.

*10*{:.journal-day} - Wow this is already a lot. How do I already have so much work? Finally sorted out the little things: email, to-do lists, etc. Ready to get to work tomorrow 

*6*{:.journal-day} A little nervous for tomorrow (first day of classes). I'm excited to be in VCD though :).

*1*{:.journal-day} Things to remember for 2019:
  - Slowing down is often the answer
  - Spend as much time as you can with the people you love, when you start to take those moments for granted, pinch yourself
  - Turn off your gadgets and look up. Frequently.<br/> Sure it's cool to capture a moment, but it's pretty special to just live it.
  - Just because they are not around does not mean they don't care about you
  - **Wear your helmet.**
  - You don't need to kiss someone at midnight [on new years], hugging your friends tight is pretty special
  - If you have your health, you have everything

Here's to a year full of opportunity, friendships, and wondrous adventures... and probably love, learning, self reflection, and art if I know myself. *–*{:.connected-thought} I'm going try and take it one day at a time. If I focus on being happy day to day, then everything else will fall into place. *–*{:.connected-thought} Can you tell I just reread [The Alchemist](https://smile.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416)? *–*{:.new-thought} Anyway, see ya around 2019.
