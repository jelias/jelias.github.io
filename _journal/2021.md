And we're back. Just in the nick of time :D. Spent the day messing around with [jelias.me/journal/](jelias.me/journal/), now there is an index of all the years. I'd like to mess around with a fixed scrolling position for the year, maybe on hover it shows 3 or 4 of the past years. 

Also, might be time to rewrite the code for links on headers. They should all underline nicely like /media writing and /journal/. We'll see. 

It's fun to be coding a bit again. Problem solving, full of documentation and forums of people. Now to figure out an ideal workflow for journaling / editing this .md file from my work computer...

Ok thinking about it for a while, I think I have an idea: I include `cp -c syncing.md for-git.md` in my automator workflow for updating the journal. This allows me to just trigger the sync before pushing live so I don't need it to run all the time in the background, just when I trigger it.

Ok so I think I've managed to get it to work. Shout out to `git stash`, still not entirely sure though... Did it?

Looks like it's working! I'll test out the other side, journaling from my work computer, tomorrow.

“My wife captured it perfectly: She said that there is so much pain and so much love, and it’s all mixed together,” he said. “But every day we’re able to disentangle them more, so that we can experience the love more purely and the pain more purely, and it doesn’t hurt to love him.”
