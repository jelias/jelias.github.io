It's already been done.

Everything has already been done. But it hurts every time. Instagram feeds full of photographers and film makers with more followers, on higher peaks, capturing things I could only dream of. 

How am I supposed to stand out? Why will my work be any better?

Be it an idea, an adventure, an image, a film, everything has already been done. Now I'm scared to try. People are going to compare them, side by side. "Hey that's already been done". "You're just copying _____"
